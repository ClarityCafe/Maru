# The Maru Experimental Board

Maru is a experimental board I created to better understand Chromium OS. Right now its primary aim is to be built and ultimately, support a wide range of hardware, ala-CloudReady.

## Roadmap

- [ ] :clap: MAKE :clap: IT :clap: BUILD :clap:

- [ ] work on driver support.
   - [ ] include Libinput support and add additional drivers (CC ArnoldTheBat if you're there please help me ;w;)

- [ ] Omaha Update server
  - This is intended for OTA updates. We want people to use Maru as a simple update.

- [ ] Other architecture support
  - i386 won't be supported, unfortunately.
